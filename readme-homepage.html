<title>XSLTv - An XSL-based client side TV grid viewing application</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>XSLTv</h1>
<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>
XSLTv is a grid viewing program for XMLTV data files. It requires only 
an xmltv data file and a modern browser. All processing is completely 
client-side and is done as-needed, resulting in a very simple 
installation.
</p>
<h2>Download:</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ericandchar.com/xsltvgrid/downloads/xsltv.zip">xsltv.zip version 1.31</a> - Compressed .zip file (161k)</li>
</ul>
<p>

<a href="http://ericandchar.com/xsltvgrid/downloads/">Old Versions</a>
</p>
<p>Notice: If you see weirdness, first try sorting your xml data with <code>tv_sort --by-channel</code>,
 which adds end-times if they're missing and makes sure there is no 
overlap of programs.  Listings in some countries have "gaps," e.g. 
program one 1:00-1:45, program two 2:00-2:30. If you have this you 
should click the "fix gaps" option in XSLTv. (Checking this option if 
you <i>don't</i> need it slows processing down.)</p>
<p>Update: XSLTv is an officially approved <a href="http://www.schedulesdirect.org/">Schedules Direct</a>
 application, so you can use this non-profit grabber to feed XSLTv. (The
 previous North-American grabber which used labs.zap2it.com has been 
discontinued.)
</p><h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>No complex installation - it could run off of your windows desktop. (In some browsers--see below)</li>
<li>Everything controlled by stylesheets - css files mimicking seven common web-based tv listings grids are included.</li>
<li>Configurable DHTML popups show more information about shows (e.g. description, rating, original airdate or release year)</li>
<li>Supports xmltv channel icons.</li>
<li>Clicking on a program optionally searches IMDB for the title, or uses a url encoded in the xml file</li>
<li>Supports dynamic loading of daily xml files, instead of a single master file.</li>
<li>Preferences allow changing grid width and number of columns.</li>
<li>Will automatically refresh hourly to keep a current grid showing at all times.
</li><li>Tested to work in new versions of both Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome and Chromium.</li>
<li>On Android, mouseover won't work, but the grid loads (from a 
webserver) in Firefox Beta, Dolphin, Opera Mobile, and Chrome. That's 
every browser I checked, but it may work on others. (I don't have an 
iDevice.)</li>
<li>Works for North American, French, Spanish, Swedish, and German listings.</li>
<li>German, English, Spanish (by Raul), French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Swedish, and Czech translations included.</li>
<li><b>This software is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a>.</b> (The data usually have non-free licenses).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation:</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://wiki.xmltv.org/index.php/XMLTVProject">Get XMLTV installed and working.</a> (This is easy, especially in Windows!)</li>
<li>Drop all the files into a directory on your webserver. <b>Note:</b> 
This software does not require a webserver; it works perfectly (in some 
browsers--see below) from a directory on a windows machine.</li>
<li>Put a current xmltv file (which <i>must</i> be either titled <code>tv.xml</code>, or with today's date <code>YYYYMMDD.xml</code>) in the same directory. You could use a series of cron jobs to automate this. <b>Note:</b>
 The smaller the xml file available to the program, the quicker this 
will run. Sorting seems to help with speed, but is not required.</li>
<li>Load <code>tv.html</code> in a webbrowser. <b>Note:</b> This file (and only this file) may be freely renamed (e.g. to <code>index.html</code>).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Optionally, put your icons directory (which should be called "icons"
 and should contain the images referenced in the xml tree) in the web 
tree. In North America, obtain icons with <code>tv_grab_na_icons</code>; subsequent <code>tv_grab_na_dd</code> calls will add the necessary references to your xml file. <b>Note:</b> Where I live, several icons are .gif files with a .jpg extension. <i>Don't correct them.</i> The links in the xml are to the .jpg extension, and the browser will display it anyhow.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Support/Comments</h2>
<ul>
<li>Email me. I'm eric, at this domain name.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problems:</h2>
<ul>
<li>It's slow. A seven-day file can take forever. Download or split into
 one- or two-day files to speed things up. Clicking the earlier/later 
links makes a browser appear to freeze for a moment.</li>
<li>It doesn't know anything about time zones. Put a time zone correction in your tv_grab_XX.conf file.</li>
<li>Most translations are <i>bad</i>. Please email me if you can help.</li>
<li>A bug in tv_split means that you can't exactly make "daily" xml 
files that divide at midnight. Where I live, they divide at 8:00 PM.</li>
<li>Not all browsers support loading xml from a local (file://) file. 
This isn't a problem on a webserver, but may be a problem when running 
"from the desktop" as advertised above.
	<ul>
		<li>Firefox- works.</li>
		<li>Opera- works if setting is changed. go to <a href="opera:config">opera:config</a>, search for "xmlhttp" and check the box for "Allow File XMLHttpRequest". THIS IS A SECURITY RISK.</li>
		<li>Chromium- works if executable is loaded with 
"--disable-web-security" command-line switch. THIS IS A SECURITY RISK 
but you could set up a shortcut just for XSLTv.</li>
		<li>Internet Explorer- works; you'll have to click "allow blocked content."</li>
		<li>Safari- untested but should work</li>
		<li>(Konqueror is not supported by XSLTv)
		</li></ul>
